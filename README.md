# Landslide-Prediction
This project uses machine learning to predict landslides based on environmental and geological data. It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training with Python. The goal is to assist in disaster risk management and improve safety in vulnerable regions.

## Key Sections

- **Dataset**: The dataset includes features such as soil type, rainfall, and elevation.
- **Methodology**: We used classification algorithms to build and train the prediction model.
- **Results**: The model accuracy, with insights into key risk factors.
- **Conclusion**: This model can assist in early warning systems for landslides. Future work includes real-time data integration.
